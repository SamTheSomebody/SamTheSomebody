👋 Hi, I’m Sam! @SamTheSomebody aka @GameDevSam.

I believe in trying incredibly hard, failing spectacularly and pushing forward. Be that:
- Running an insanely unprofitable flower farm 💐 - 7800 hours over 2.5 years, $8000 profit 
- Washing up as a content creator 👀 - Over 100k views 
- Seeing a cyber-security education start-up to its bitter end 🔐 - Over $1m funding


Currently, I'm popping my game development dreams to side to focus on being the absolute best developer I can be 💪 I'm working on:
- A real estate investment website with a data scraper and predictive algorthms (React, Tailwind, PostgresSQL, Python)
- Pomodo: a CLI pomodoro to-do list (Go, Bubbletea, Cobra, SQLite)


I'm currently looking to help businesses in a full-stack or backend web development role. I'd especially love to work at a startup on a tight knit team where I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!
