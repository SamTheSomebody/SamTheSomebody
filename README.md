ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sam! @SamTheSomebody aka @GameDevSam.

I believe in trying incredibly hard, failing spectacularly and pushing forward. Be that running an insanely unprofitable flower farm, washing up as a content creator or seeing a cyber-secturity education start-up to its bitter end. Currently, I'm popping my game development dreams to side to focus on being the absolute best developer I can be.

I'm working on:
- A real estate investment website with a data scraper and predictive algorthms (React, Tailwind, PostgresSQL, Python)
- Pomodo: a CLI pomodoro to-do list (Go, Bubbletea, Cobra, SQLite)


I'm currently looking to help businesses in a full-stack or backend web development role. I'd especially love to work at a startup on a tight knit team where I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!
